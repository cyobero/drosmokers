# Drosmokers
This is an app that keeps track of the strains I've smoked.

## Quick Setup
Make sure you have Docker installed. If not, install from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
Spin up a docker container by running the following on the command line

`docker-compose -d --build`

If all goes well, then open a web browser and go to `localhost:8000`.
